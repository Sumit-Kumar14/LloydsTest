The app was created using the Dog [API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/). It contains two screens:

Dogs List: Displays a grid of dogs filtered by breed.
Breed Search: Shows a list of breeds that can be searched.
The app is organized into different modules:
 - App
 - Core: Contains submodules such as Network and UI, with the possibility of extending to include others like Local.
 - Features: Includes app features such as List and Search.
 - Each feature is divided into three layers - Data, Domain, Presentation
 - All th UI is build completely in Jetpack compose
